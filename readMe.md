## Programmer Perspective
I just implement link list in C language for learning purpose.
This program is created in C.

singly linked list with the features of
	add at the beginning
				end
				after some data
				before some data
				at position
	delete at particular position
				particular data
	sort in ascending
			descending order   ....  sorting must be of node not of only data  oh!!!! but by make reverse link list

## Direct from Developer
This best way to learn pointer concept of C language and think deep in algorithms.
